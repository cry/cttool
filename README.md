# Certificate Transparency toolkit

## This tool most likely no longer works, and is hence depreciated.

**tl;dr point towards hostname will scan logged ssl certs for other domain names with option to check if a records are still valid**

Certificate transparency essentially logs new TLS certificates as they are issued to centralised logging servers run by Google/Symantec. By querying these logs for all issued certificates, it is possible to obtain a list of all hostnames to which TLS certificates have been issued.

## Usage:

    npm install

    chmod +x cttool
	./cttool discover example.com

## Example output:

	srzd :: ~/cttool ‹master*› » ./cttool discover example.com -c -f res.json
